## Vizualizing all food orders placed online

In this project I have vizualized all the food orders I have placed in the last 9 months using services like foodpanda, Deliveroo, Domino's and UberEets.

I have written a blog post for the detailed analysis which can be found [here](http://localhost:4000/oloviz/).

You can also take a look at the [Tableau Workbook for this project](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ichait#!/vizhome/oloviz/DayofWeekvsOrdersStats) that contains all the visualizations.


## Scraping the Data


* `get_foodpanda_olo.py` - Script for scraping foodpanda orders
* `get_deliveroo_olo.py` - Script for scraping deliveroo orders
* `merge_all_olo.py` - Script for combining orders from foodpanda, deliveroo, ubereats and domino's


## Dependencies

* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
* [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html)


## Working


* Go to the URL of order history for website you are scraping data.

> Eg. https://www.foodpanda.sg/orders

* Then, open the Network's Tab in Developer Console

* Copy the request for the web page as CURL command

* Use this [little tool](https://curl.trillworks.com/) to get the python code

* Use the cookies obtained from above in your code


## Note

For storing your cookies - 

### get_foodpanda_olo.py

In `main`, there is a list of cookies -

```python
cookies = ['cookies for user 1', 'cookies for user 2']
```

If there are more than one users (as in my case), store cookies of all those users in a python list (separated by `,`) as shown above. If there is only one user just save your cookie in that list.


### get_deliveroo_olo.py


For this script, update the below code snippet in the script with your own cookies.

```python
    cookies = {
                    'cookie': 'your cookies here',
    }
```



* I did not scrape orders from UberEats and Domino's and rather wrote them in manually, so you won't find script for scraping those websites.

* I save csv files for orders of all the services that I have used and finally use the `merge_all_olo.py` to create a consolidated file of orders `final_orders.csv` that I later import into Tableau for creating vizualizations.



## TODO's

* Accommodate for multiple users in `get_deliveroo_olo.py` - same as foodpanda script, mantain a list of cookies.
* Use selenium to scrape domino's orders.
* Cleanup and make `Items Ordered` more structured so that it easy to anayze that data field.
* Use a food database API to gather nutrition value of each meal and items.
